## Me

Hi! I'm Simon. Online I'm usually psimyn. They are pronounced the same.

I have done some talks on Responsive Design, Offline Websites, and some other frontendy things.

I love CSS, and tolerate Javascript. It's getting better but it still tends to be overcomplicated. The current state of performance and tracking on the web makes me feel ill. We have a lot of work to do there.

Before frontending I tried Electronic Engineering for a while, but was not very good at it. Still usually interested in talking about it if you're into electronics, firmware or networking hardware.

I hope you are having a great day.
