<p>A lot of programmers get to that second 90%, get tired and bored and frustrated, and change jobs, or lose focus, or find excuses to procrastinate.  There are a million ways not to finish a project, but there’s only one way to finish:  Put your head down and grind it out until it’s done.  Do that, and I promise you the programming world will be yours.</p>
