<p>This is cooool. I've been into eye-tracking since seeing <a href="https://webdirections.org/design18/speakers/eduardo-velloso.php">a talk</a> on it a couple of years ago. Had figured any kind of accuracy needed more than just visual pupil tracking so this being even remotely accurate is neat.</p>
