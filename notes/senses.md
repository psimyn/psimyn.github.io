## sight

- what are rods and cones? What do they physically look like? how do they work?
- motion sense vs objects vs color
- how do we see color?
- how is your red different to my red?
- what are cultural differences (the "japan doesn't have a word for green") vs physical differences
- do drugs affect physical perception or just brain
- can you correct vision just using the brain?
- could you use webcams for eyes?
- what is current state of the art for vision replacement?
- could you trust vision replacement? Color/brightness adjustments
- could that be done externally (glasses)?
- why are sunglasses for VR not possible/practical? What is the physical limitation at play here for rendering?
- how does focus of eyes work? How does it work in VR for fake focus?
- do frames of glasses affect vision? I still see them after 5 years of wearing.

## sound

- do you "hear" 10Hz?
- how do we convert the movement of ear molecules into electrical signals?
- why do we do this?
- could you use a DAC directly from audio input to ear?
- how do bone conduction headphones work?
- do they work?
- how is the fidelity?
- how much does frequency sensitivity curve affect hearing?
- can tinnitus be treated? Physically? Mentally?
- what are sonic cannons? Are they unsafe?

## smell

- seems an early/common thing to fade
- bad/overpowering more commongly noticed that pleasant/neutral smells
- do we notice neutral/mild smells? Do supersmellers?
- are supersmellers real? Physical difference or teachable skill?
- how much is recognition vs identification/classification?

## taste

- what is crossover with smell here?
- how strong is influence from bacteria in the mouth?
- similar to smell - physical vs trained skills

## touch

- hermunculous man and focus on different parts
- when touching your nose with your finger, is it a stronger sensation in finger or nose?
- how much is due to nerve endings vs brain perception? (open question for all senses)

## balance

- is this intrinsically tied to hearing due to inner ear stuff? or can be independent?
- can be affected by vision (VR/motion sickness/vertigo), then you experience the change in this sense
