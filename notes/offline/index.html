<h3 id="1.-why">1. Why <a class="direct-link" href="#1.-why" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>current offline UX mostly awful</li>
<li>offline not just for offline. slow internet is almost worse</li>
<li>but offline still common with mobile networks</li>
<li>and lots of still-offline locations</li>
<li>we can!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2.-how">2. How <a class="direct-link" href="#2.-how" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>How do we know if someone is offline? What does offline even mean?</p>
<p>detecting offline is easy - not connected to any network. So no wifi or cable.<br>
But if you <em>are</em> connected to a network, how can you tell if that's the internet<br>
or just a regular net?</p>
<p><code>navigator.onLine</code>. weird casing.<br>
this can tell you if you are offline (<code>onLine === false</code>) or &quot;not offline&quot; (<code>navigator.onLine === true</code>). Not offline is not necessarily online.</p>
<p>If their router is connected (and real), maybe their ISP is down. Maybe their government censors content. If the ISP is up, mayeb the server of the site is down.<br>
Or at capacity.</p>
<p>So the most reliable way to test it monitor network requests. If a bunch of them<br>
fail, you're probably offline. There's some events you can listen for, you could<br>
use a dedicated polling thing that checks some cheap isUp endpoint, whatever.<br>
Lots of options here.</p>
<p>brief PSA on using .catch correctly. What does .catch mean for fetch<br>
what does it mean for your network lib, or your API wrappers or whatever.<br>
Learn some stuff about errors they are great.<br>
Optimistic approach to errors means expecting them. Plan for them. Do something better than showing unhelpful error.</p>
<p>Assume someone clicks a button, then puts their phone straight back into their pocket. And their pants are made of lead, blocking any signal.</p>
<h3 id="3.-what">3. What <a class="direct-link" href="#3.-what" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>Plan for the person that has been to site once before. Now they're waiting at an airport,<br>
their flight has been delayed 45 minutes, and they want to read some more.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1. offline.html</strong><br>
Plain page to replace browser default.<br>
Bad news for Chrome users. No longer have a dinosaur game, or the Download When Online button.<br>
Arguably worse experience than browser default.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2. blog.html</strong><br>
So we want something better than static page, let's give people some content.<br>
Fallback to &quot;sorry, can't get that. Would you like to view one of these?&quot;</p>
<p>NB: on pre-emptive loading. Be nice to people's data. TODO: is there a way to detect<br>
network type ala &quot;wifi only download&quot;? Assume small is ok, so you can download text<br>
content and maybe small images. Check what your market is ok with.</p>
<p>We can do better than this still. If we can grab text in the background, and we have<br>
a &quot;people also enjoyed:&quot; links. Use Analytics data, and then pre-emptively fetches content<br>
for those in idle times. So if you come to my blog and visit two pages, auto-download a couple more.</p>
<p>Also the idea of timebox/location-based &quot;predictive&quot; offline. If a user is going<br>
to leave the house and going to the station, sync some things that matter. (opt-in to download all)</p>
<p>This is a common pattern for News, Social Media, anything that is post-oriented is ok.<br>
In SW/Toolbox terms it's called staleWhileRevalidate.<br>
But holy shit please do not use this for time-sensitive data. Especially not if<br>
you are printing relative times on screen. Looking at you PTV app.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3. forms</strong></p>
<p>Adds a lot of potential, and a lot of complexity</p>
<p>The traditional optimistic UI: like/star button<br>
works, but does nothing. Probably not a big deal<br>
The offline optimistic UI: updates live now, really later.<br>
Button queues a request, then actually updates later. Sounds simple... BUT:</p>
<ul>
<li>should you notify the user?
<ul>
<li>if it succeeds, probably not.</li>
<li>If it fails?...
<ul>
<li>&quot;Your like failed. Click here if you still like it&quot;</li>
<li>toast next time they are in app.</li>
<li>(ab)use push notifications</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Race conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Like button clicked on Phone. Phone placed in faraday cage. Or lead pants</li>
<li>Like button clicked on PC. Change of mind, thing unliked.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, so far so simple. Let's try a more complex form.</p>
<p>You know what is worse than filling out forms? Submitting them when you're offline and<br>
getting an error page. Because then you have to fill them out twice.</p>
<p>For any short fields, make autocomplete work. For comment fields, longer notes,<br>
save locally. And save lots. Discarded data is very annoying.</p>
<p>Caveat: don't cache sensitive info. In either formdata or localstorage.<br>
Also applies to caching data that requires auth. If you need to be logged in,<br>
you can encrypt data locally and access with a token, or keep it in sessionStorage<br>
or something else. But be sure that the data doesn't live longer than a session</p>
<p>Step 4. Collaborative Docs</p>
<p>This is where data storage method gets more important. You cannot just store &quot;here's the text&quot;<br>
type values anymore. Think about changes, about conflicts.</p>
<p>NB: sending and handling notifications offline. What happens if someone clicks a<br>
notification while offline? It closes. Does your site work? Can they save it or<br>
get notified again when they can reach it. Can you pre-emptively fetch the page content.<br>
Should you? There are limits, don't be a dick</p>
<p>Step 5. Chat / Games etc</p>
<p>Highly interactive, network-dependent.<br>
This requires a different experience for online vs offline. e.g. Bot that pops up<br>
&quot;you're offline, want me to send that for you later?&quot;<br>
For games, you could drop into training mode. e.g. Chess - &quot;Currently offline, analyze board&quot;.<br>
Or &quot;continue against computer&quot;. Or training mode.</p>
<h2 id="scratchpad">Scratchpad <a class="direct-link" href="#scratchpad" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Connection continuum: Offline -- Flaky -- Slow -- Fast</p>
<p>Slow and fast are self explanatory. Flaky is an interesting case. What do you think<br>
would happen if every 4th request failed? That is something like what happens<br>
when you have congestion issues. Some requests will take ages, some will fail.</p>
<p>Quality continuum: someone else's error &lt;&lt; your error &lt;&lt; some content &lt;&lt; the actual content</p>
<p>Be Optimistic - Assume devices will reconnect at some point.</p>
<p>Australian internet is rather awful - e.g speedtest screenshot from home<br>
Also: <a href="https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1008561176408707078">https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1008561176408707078</a></p>
<p>show that the default offline experience means abandoning people. You are trusting<br>
the browser to do something</p>
<p>requests are like sheep. Body can only be consumed once, so <code>clone</code> first</p>
<hr>
<p>whatsapp is good for offline - message just gets sent.<br>
duplicates not a big deal; most people only use one device, so won't accidentally send twice<br>
facebook failed file upload from phone<br>
Self-first sync (for chat). Confirm before auto sending. More hassle than benefit</p>
<hr>
<p>Does offline last? Why was Guardian crossword shutdown? TODO. Maintenance concerns??</p>
<p>Updating cached data when your service worker updates<br>
note on updating SW version without losing your precious offline pages. You need em.</p>
<p>if you are offline, it should tell you as soon as possssible<br>
if your connection is slow, should offer them the chance to come back later</p>
<p>button for dinosaur game that uses chrome's version<br>
alternatively just use regular js version</p>
<hr>
<p>Polling</p>
<ul>
<li>don't retry non-repeatable actions<br>
e.g. if Post Comment starts polling</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Offline sync</strong><br>
this is the sync problem compounded. Because you are very likely to cause<br>
conflicts somewhere. if you do cause conflicts, cause them in the way that<br>
doesn't again cause future conflicts. Let's quickly look at something that does<br>
a terrible job of this: git. We are editing the following 3 line file. 3 lines,<br>
what could possibly happen.</p>
<p>Jane and Jim are editing a shared file. line 1 has some text added by both<br>
Now both see a conflicts view.<br>
This is designed to be resolved offline.</p>
<p>Choosing a sync model<br>
this is a tricky, tricky thing<br>
but pretty great experience. If we have comments, and I want to copy them to notepad or something, then back to the browser, I should be able to do that<br>
Rather than storing text, store actions/deltas. See redux, quilljs etc for things here.</p>
<p>Online vs Offline conflict resolution. Offline is actually easier, pushes the responsibility<br>
onto them. Online requires lock or something. There are tools to<br>
help with this (firebase or quilljs), but you want to have a conceptual understanding<br>
of what's going on</p>
<p>Offline-only mode</p>
<ul>
<li>You must be offline to continue page (offline-only page)</li>
<li>could have focus mode, and you add not distracted mode which requires you be disconnected</li>
</ul>
<p>tip: I started this in dropbox note. simple and pretty reliable (NEVER want to lose)<br>
terrible sync support though. If it detects a conflict it just duplicates your files</p>
<p>Getting Buy In: if you need to convince people of business value.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>tell them you can do push notifications. Marketing people love push notifcations. I think they are horrible. But that's your in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>resumeable downloads. Probably handled by browser (since some chrome version)<br>
but for time limited auth some things might need to be done.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="devs-vs-users">Devs vs users <a class="direct-link" href="#devs-vs-users" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>avoid making too much distinction between users and devs. Hopefully you should be both. If not, please please<br>
start using your site more. Helps develop empathy.</li>
<li>having reload cache all the time can be good. But then you forget what its really like for users.<br>
Most people don't force reload all the time. So make sure that you're sure that your caches are being invalidated<br>
and people aren't stuck with the new stuff forever</li>
