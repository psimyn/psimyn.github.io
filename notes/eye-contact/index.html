<p>VR allows face-to-face communication, you have elements of gaze tracking, with the tradeoff of no facial expressions or realism<br>
Video calls allow eye contact, but it's either artificial (software gaze correction) or faked (looking at camera instead of screen). This is quite a strange disconnect from reality.</p>
<h2 id="questions">Questions <a class="direct-link" href="#questions">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>is eye contact actually important in face-to-face?</li>
<li>does &quot;face&quot; contact work instead? Looking at forehead/nose/mouth?</li>
<li>does the same hold true for people self conscious about some aspect of their face (worried about people staring at mole or scar)</li>
<li>can you actually tell where someone is looking?</li>
<li>are microsaccades detectable? Do we notice them?</li>
<li>are women more used to the downward gaze of zoom calls?</li>
<li>what about looking away in face-to-face conversations? Plenty of topics that are easier <em>without</em> eye contact</li>
<li>it is not always about contact vs avoidant</li>
<li>strangers vs people you know</li>
<li>video calls have the other elements of uncertainty - alt tabbing, looking at another screen etc.</li>

<li>for self-assessment, is the word &quot;arousal&quot; a loaded term here?</li>

<li><a href="htps://techxplore.com/news/2019-06-intel-eye-contact-video-chats.html">Intel concept</a>
<ul>
<li>only active when looking at screen (don't correct when looking away)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;attention correction&quot; (disconcerting name) made it into iOS13, had issues in some cases; wearing glasses caused artifacts</li>
<li>would you actually want this? Introduces issue of faking attention. Though I guess this already exists in various RL interactions - from eye-contact avoidance things like &quot;look at forehead&quot;</li>
<li>some bullshit paywalled study &quot;debunking&quot; the importance of eye contact from when researcher looked at mouth</li>
<li>eye tracking studies seem hard when they depend on weird-looking glasses, though maybe people are fine with them I'd feel pretty self-conscious</li>
