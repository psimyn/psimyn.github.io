trying Svelte

- Docs have straightforward first example, then covers API docs. Missing some middle ground for setup, but very easy to follow
- cli gets setup and stuff works
- main thing missing is hot/live reloading. For this we can start by adding browser plugin or a build script to do this.


I started with some sanity checks. `bind:checked` works! Seems like an overly simple thing to test for, but checkboxes are important to me
