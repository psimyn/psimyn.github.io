<p>From <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20998256">this Hacker News post</a></p>
<p>I loved this from the HN comments alone.<br>
People were either talking about their own sites, bemoaning the loss of control &amp; ownership with the rise of social media behemoths<br>
And asking some questions on getting started, or mentioning that they had</p>
<p>As for <a href="https://www.vanschneider.com/a-love-letter-to-personal-websites">Tobias' Love Letter to his site</a>, so much to like.</p>
<p>Great reasons to have and maintain a site. And his site itself was beautiful. Nice to read, well written, interesting layout, onbeforeunload animations!<br>
Simple but not a SPA - a great example of doing something simple like keeping working links, but still having a more appy feel.</p>
<p>The site itself is also very beautiful. Posts have large type and just generally nice layout. The kind of page that makes me feel grossly inadequate at style, but also inspired to try harder.<br>
On the <a href="https://www.vanschneider.com/blog">blog list page</a> is a cool wave-like animation behind the text as you scroll down.</p>
<p>And lazy images, but still with dimensions set so content doesn't jump. Lovely!</p>
<p>So thanks Tobias, for inspiring me to make my own site either less gross or more ridiculous. Hopefully both.</p>
