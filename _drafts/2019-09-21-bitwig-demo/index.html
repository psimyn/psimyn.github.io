<p>I was reading <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20965386">this great HN thread</a> and people asked about linux-friendly Ableton. As macOS is very just about dead to me I really want something that I can use on Linux/Windows as well. Had previously been playing around with Ardour and Repear, but have always missed the layout/workflow of Ableton. A bit simpler and better-suited for assembling things out of loops and samples.</p>
<p>Downloaded <a href="https://www.bitwig.com/en/download.html">Bitwig Studio</a> (~230MB) and installed to have a play. This is how you do demo software! Fully featured, everything works except save/export. For my early trials this is <em>perfect</em> as I'm basically at the level of doing covers of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4k1IK_o59M">Human Music</a>.</p>
<p>But playing around with The Grid and some of the other built-in stuff this almost definitely feels like a buy.</p>
