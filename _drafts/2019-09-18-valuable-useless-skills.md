Saw this tweet recently. I either learned that or learned that I could do it while doing a SCUBA course in high school. I've barely dived since, but this has meant flights and tall elevators are never a big deal since I auto adjust as needed.

Also learned a few circus skills in school -  unicycling, juggling, fire spinning. Again not very practical, had no reason for learning them other than for the sake of learning. But long term effects have been better hand-eye coordination, and much better at being ambidextrous at things. Still cannot write/draw left-handed or other fine motor skills, but I have a much better ability for mirroring stuff with arms/legs than I would otherwise. This comes in handy all the damn time.

Additionally served as a useful resume standout thing - listed on my resume for my first few jobs, and ALWAYS got questions/comments in interviews about it.

So learning skills for the enjoyment of it, rather than specific work-related outcomes. Play, rather than practice. Still do intentional practice if you want to optimize a skill, or learn a specific new trick. But for the most part just do things because they are fun.
