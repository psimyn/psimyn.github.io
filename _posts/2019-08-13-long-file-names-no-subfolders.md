I love [this tweet](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1145354949871767552): "Long names, flat folders"

And [Adam Wathan's original](https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1145109572081860610a)

Multiple files with same name is unclear - typing index.js in a project with hundreds of them is not a good time. Needless categorisation and sorting is not very useful, and having a bunch of folders with only one or two files is just frustrating to navigate.

Browsing relevant files for an app is way easier if I can just see a list without clicking through folders all the time. Grouping can be done with filename prefixes/suffixes.

Fewer folders, longer filenames!
