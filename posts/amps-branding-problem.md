Last month I went to AMP Roadshow in Melbourne. Was a day of presentations and a bit of playing around with AMP stuff. AMP appears to be quite a different project to what it was three years ago. This is quite a drastic shift, and it's more like a lightweight (citation needed) framework for making webapps. There is a lot of problematic history with it's early attempts at gross fixed top bars and a lot of double loading to get to actual content. But as a simple app framework it shows promise. Kinda like what I had wanted from Polymer Elements but with a friendlier API.
