Writing script to register domains when they drop.

I've been looking for excuses to get some practice in writing little snippets to automate easy tasks and learn linux CLI tools a little better.

Last week I waned to automate some annoying early-morning tasks. Needed to hit an API endpoint repeatedly to see if a name was available, then register it when I could.

Things I learned:
- Reading/writing to text files
- Looping over lines in a file
- editing a file (removing lines)
- while loops
- refactoring script into functions
- adding cron task
