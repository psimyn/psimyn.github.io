Choosing a dental floss is harder than I thought. Trying a new floss is a low cost but long running experiment. Only costs a few dollars, but now I have 100m of it now and already hate it not even 10m in. The floss itself is ok, flatter profile than before. But it keeps coming off the damn spool and I have to crack open the container and fix it. I didn't sign up for this, Colgate.

Now conflicted about whether to:

- stick it out for however many months
- spend (waste) time trying to improve the spool and reduce loose threading
- throw it away and
  - buy my regular floss
  - try yet another one

Too many choices. So for now will stick with it and keep complainin.
