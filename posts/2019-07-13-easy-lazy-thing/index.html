      <h1>The Easy Lazy Thing</h1>

<p>It's very easy to put things off, so that's what I usually do. The most common way is getting stuck on some tiny detail, then obsessing over that and choosing not to proceed. Tech things are great for this - you can get stuck on tech stack, hardware choices, platforms to use, needless future planning. Millions of tiny details. Most don't matter.</p>
<p>A big one for me was always to put off writing. I won't write a todo list without a quick runthrough of 5 or 6 different options for this. Plain text is simple and portable, but maybe I want formatting or embedded content. List-specific apps are often too short, and some tasks need a bit more details and description. I need something that works reliably offline, but that also syncs between phone and a few computers. At this point people often suggest paper, but I tend not to complete those or just leave them in another room. I've fot todos on my whiteboard (which is right next to the damn desk) from weeks ago.</p>
<p>What helps with all this is having a good easy default thing. It doesn't have to be the best thing. Or even a particularly great thing. If it's not actively terrible then it's better than indecisive stagnation.</p>
<p>I started actually writing semi regularly when I had a single synced file as my default notepad. I occasionally start stuff there and move it, but a lot of the random notes just stay there which is just fine for now. Doing the thing is better than researching 10 alternative ways of doing the thing, and developing a framework to compare them.</p>
