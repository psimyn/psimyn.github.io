Something that has come up repeatedly in the past year is that quitting things entirely is often easier than reducing. 

Some recent occurences were a [Tim Ferris Q&A](https://tim.blog/2019/10/10/tim-on-happiness-dating-depressive-episodes/) where he talks about the 'one decision to remove 1000 decisions', and in [Clay Christenssen speech to HBS graduates](https://hbr.org/2010/07/how-will-you-measure-your-life) where he doesn't play ball on Sundays. "Just this once" means the question can come up literally every time the possibility exists. And you can waste a lot of time thinking up ways to justify it that still fit into whatever rules you have. 

Last week I tried to reduce coffee drinking to one per day. One both Monday and Wednesday I ended up having three! This is partly out of habit, partly out of a cheat-day mentality, Easier is to stop entirely; I usually do this when I travel.
